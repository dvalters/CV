### Winds QEv

#### AMV

##### Monthly Monitoring

Could not display plots table from December 2015 onwards. (I.e. Presumably no results from the database query - may just not have been updated recently). The plots definitely exist because you can navigate to them from an earlier month by clicking 'foward month' in the popup window.

##### Links

A lot of the external links are dead or dont link to page intended. KNMI/ECMWF links dead, ESA PCS links to home page of that site.

##### Investigations/Use in NWP

A lot of the links link back to the old site here.

#### Scatterometer

No 2016 plots yet

##### NRT Plots (ASCAT etc.)

All these plot's popup windows have 'undefined' in the plot type title. I think it's a Javascript issue.
