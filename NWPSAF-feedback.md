Hi Dave,

Nice to see the site is nearly ready to go! Overall I couldn't find any pressing issues, most of these are minor/pedantic things. Speed is good, I almost forgot to mention this because I didn't actually notice it, which is good. 

Tested under Google Chrome v48 on Linux (Fedora) and Windows 7. Had a brief test on IE on Windows too, no major differences.

## Home page

On Chrome, the graphic in the News Feature sidebar on the right does not display (but it did in IE...). Instead I just get the little missing image icon and the name of the image file...

## Monitoring Pages

### Winds QEv

#### AMV

##### Monthly Monitoring

Could not display plots table from December 2015 onwards. (I.e. Presumably no results from the database query - may just not have been updated recently). The plots definitely exist because you can navigate to them from an earlier month by clicking 'foward month' in the popup window.

##### Useful Links

A lot of the external links are dead or dont link to page intended. KNMI/ECMWF links dead, ESA PCS links to home page of that site.

##### Investigations/Use in NWP

A lot of the links link back to the old site here.

#### Scatterometer

No 2016 plots yet

##### NRT Plots (ASCAT etc.)

All these plot's popup windows have 'undefined' in the plot type title. I think it's a Javascript issue.

#### DBNet

~~IASI, CrIS and ATMS monitoring pages are not functioning. (Nothing in the drop down selection boxes)~~, ah they work today!

Statistics link links back to the old site.

Minor use-ability point, but the ATOVS page will automatically update the plot when a dropdown box is changed, but the others (IASI, CrIS and ATMS) require the user to click 'go' before anything happens. (

#### NRT Quality

Text in these tables is really small.

#### Data Alerts

ECMWF link is dead.
Helpdesk link here is dead.

## Software

### RTTOV

FAQs is linked to in the drop down 2nd level menu, but not on the RTTOV static menu. (Oh no wait it's under the RTTOV v11 drop down.)

**Downloading RTTOV archived version 7.1**. The link did not work:

> Error message:
> File /var/chroot/home/content/94/6992894/repository/old_versions/ does not exist! Key: !

All the other ones I tested worked fine. 

## Design Stuff

I know this will sound picky, but the banner image on the front page uses a different font to the rest of the site (and is in italics). And you can't really see the image because it's covered by the text...which is white and blends in with the clouds... But I like the banner!

The text in a lot of the tables is very small.


**P.S. Apologies if some of these bugs were caused by me!**
