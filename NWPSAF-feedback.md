## Monitoring Pages

### Winds QEv

#### AMV

##### Monthly Monitoring

Could not display plots table from December 2015 onwards. (I.e. Presumably no results from the database query - may just not have been updated recently). The plots definitely exist because you can navigate to them from an earlier month by clicking 'foward month' in the popup window.

##### Useful Links

A lot of the external links are dead or dont link to page intended. KNMI/ECMWF links dead, ESA PCS links to home page of that site.

##### Investigations/Use in NWP

A lot of the links link back to the old site here.

#### Scatterometer

No 2016 plots yet

##### NRT Plots (ASCAT etc.)

All these plot's popup windows have 'undefined' in the plot type title. I think it's a Javascript issue.

#### DBNet

IASI, CrIS and ATMS monitoring pages are not functioning. (Nothing in the drop down selection boxes)
Statistics link links back to the old site.

#### NRT Quality

Text in these tables is really small.

#### Data Alerts

ECMWF link is dead.
Helpdesk link here is dead.

## Software

### RTTOV

FAQs is linked to in the drop down 2nd level menu, but not on the RTTOV static menu. (Oh no wait it's under the RTTOV v11 drop down.)
